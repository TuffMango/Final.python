NPC Character Generator

OVERVIEW

This generator makes NPCs, it includes their stats like strength, power, and their moves, and if they are strong enough they have a ultimate move. The move's damage is based off the characters stats mutiplied or added by the damage of the attack. This creates a dynamic stat and power system that rely on eachother to work.

HIGHLIGHTS

*Dynamic character naming system
*Dynamic character stat system
*random move generator
*damages of moves are based off of stats
*asks how many characters you wish to generate

This software was written by Tuffmango with the purpose to put out random npcs that have a extremely extremely low chance to be the exact same. As the dynamic random system is given enough numbers, names, moves, and other variables to creat a unique character each time. The chances of the system creating the same character twice are slim to none.
This software is also easy to  understand, it can be broken down into only a couple of lines of code (roughly 60)
and it is extremely easy to understand.  You input a number, the system creates a npc and choices a random name from the list, random stats 1-100, random moves, then it mutiplies or adds the damage of that move to the stat it is based on, then it outputs the new npc, the moves on to the next one, depending on the input. The code is simple to use and simple to edit, easy to understand. The code contains notes explaning how stuff works to help with understanding if needed.
